## ABSTRACT


Large language models (LLMs) augmented with external data have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in completing real-world tasks. External data not only bolsters the models' domain-specific expertise and temporal relevance but also diminishes incidences of hallucination, thereby enhancing both the controllability and interpretability of outputs. Techniques for integrating external data into LLMs, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, are gaining increasing attention and widespread application. Nonetheless, the effective deployment of data-augmented LLMs across various specialized fields presents substantial challenges. These challenges encompass a wide range of issues, from retrieving relevant data and accurately interpreting user intent to fully harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for complex tasks. We believe that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for data-augmented LLM applications. In practice, underperformance often arises from a failure to correctly identify the core focus of a task or because the task inherently requires a blend of multiple capabilities that must be disentangled for better resolution. In this survey, we propose a RAG task categorization method, classifying user queries into four levels based on the type of external data required and the task's primary focus: explicit fact queries, implicit fact queries, interpretable rationale queries, and hidden rationale queries. We define these levels of queries, provide relevant datasets, and summarize the key challenges and most effective techniques for addressing these challenges. Finally, we discuss three main forms of integrating external data into LLMs: context, small model, and fine-tuning, highlighting their respective strengths, limitations, and the types of problems they are suited to solve. This work aims to help readers thoroughly understand and decompose the data requirements and key bottlenecks in building LLM applications, offering solutions to the different challenges and serving as a guide to systematically developing such applications.


## 1 Introduction


Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, including extensive world knowledge and sophisticated reasoning skills. Despite these advancements, there are significant challenges in effectively deploying them across various specialized fields. These challenges include issues like model hallucinations, misalignment with domain-specific knowledge, among others. Incorporating domain-specific data, particularly private or on-premise data that could not be included in their initial training corpus, is crucial for tailoring LLM applications to meet specific industry needs. Through techniques like RAG and fine tuning, data augmented LLM applications have demonstrated advantages over applications built solely on generic LLMs, in several aspects:

- Enhanced Professionalism and Timeliness: The data used to train LLMs often lags in timeliness and may not cover all domains comprehensively, especially proprietary data owned by users. Data augmented LLM applications address this issue by providing more detailed and accurate answers for complex questions, allowing for data updates and customization.
- Alignment with Domain Experts: Through the use of and learning from domain-specific data, data augmented LLM applications can exhibit capabilities more like domain experts, such as doctors and lawyers.
