When dealing with structured data, converting natural language queries to SQL (NL2SQL) can be an effective approach. Tools like Chat2DB facilitate this process by translating user queries into database queries. In the era of large language models, there has been significant progress in the area of text-to-SQL[105, 106, 107, 108], which allows us to utilize these tools to retrieve information from structured databases. This capability serves as a valuable external data source to augment the generation capabilities of LLMs. By integrating text-to-SQL tools [109], LLMs can access and incorporate structured data, enhancing their ability to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This integration not only improves the depth and quality of the generated content but also expands the scope of LLM applications, enabling them to perform more complex tasks that require interaction with and interpretation of database content.


## 4.6 Discussion on Fact Queries


Whether to Use Fine-tuning . Some works [110] have demonstrated the hardness of LLMs to acquire new factual knowledge during fine tuning. This process can lead to a deterioration in the overall performance of the LLMs in generating accurate responses, and it often results in the generation of more hallucinations. Furthermore, study [111] suggests that fine-tuning LLMs with new factual data may cause the models to mechanically memorize fact statements. Interestingly, altering the phrasing of these memorized facts can render the recently learned knowledge ineffective, indicating a superficial level of understanding and retention by the LLMs. This points to limitations in the current fine-tuning processes and the need for more sophisticated methods to integrate and adapt new information effectively.


Whether to Separate Different Levels of Fact Queries . Both explicit fact queriesand implicit fact queriesare fact-based, and it is crucial to determine which level these queries belong before constructing data augmented LLM applications. Misclassifying explicit fact queriesas implicit fact queriescan lead to the retrieval of an abundance of superficial information that is seemingly relevant but ultimately unhelpful for answering the question, which can mislead the LLM and waste computational resources. Conversely, mistaking implicit fact queriesfor explicit fact queriescan prevent the use of appropriate methods to retrieve a sufficient and comprehensive set of external auxiliary data. Implicit fact queries often require dynamically integrating information specific to the context of the queries, whereas explicit fact queriesgenerally need only a single data snippet, leading to the retrieval of a fixed amount of external data. This can result in suboptimal performance of the LLM. Therefore, it is advantageous to preliminarily distinguish the level of queries based on a thorough understanding of the target task. Additionally, considerable effort has been directed towards training models to autonomously assess whether the information retrieved is sufficient, exemplified by approaches such as self-RAG [92].


## 5 Interpretable Rationale Queries (L3)


## 5.1 Overview


In this section and the next, we will explore queries that necessitate external data to furnish rationales for their resolution. These queries demand not only a grasp of the factual content but also the ability to comprehend and apply domainspecific rationales that are integral to the data's context. We classify these queries into two categories based on the nature of the rationales involved: queries based on interpretable rationales and those based on hidden rationales, as illustrated in the Figure 4.


Interpretable rationale queries represent a relatively straightforward category within applications that rely on external data to provide rationales. The auxiliary data for these types of queries often include clear explanations of the thought processes used to solve problems. The data can be organized in several forms:

- Plain Texts : Textual descriptions are the most common form of presenting interpretable rationales. These may include specialized or official documents such as handbooks or guidelines, as well as domain-specific manuals or operational guides. These texts articulate the reasoning processes that facilitate decision-making in complex scenarios. For example, documents such as FDA Guidance for pharmaceutical factories or medication guides for physicians provide insights into how experts, like FDA officers or doctors, approach specific cases.
- Structured Instructions : More explicit reasoning relationships or decision pathways might be presented in a structured format. These rationales can be understood as either a Text-Conditioned Moore Machine or a Text-Conditioned Mealy Machine. In the theory of computation, a Moore machine is a finite-state machine where the output values are determined solely by its current state 4 . The conditions that control state transitions are often expressed in text, which LLMs need to interpret, unlike traditional programs that operate on native code. For instance, consider a customer supporting agent that follows a handbook to handle user's request to product changing or refunding. Similarly, a Mealy machine is a finite-state machine where output values are determined by both its current state and the inputs 5 . The distinction here is that actions (such as API calls) are determined not only by the state but also by the textual messages associated with transitions from the previous state. Naturally, these domain-specific rationales can be represented in formats such as workflows, decision trees, or pseudocode.
