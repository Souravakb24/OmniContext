Here are some examples of queries at this level:

- How should a patient with chest pain and specific symptom descriptions be diagnosed and treated (given a chest pain management guideline)
- How to respond to a user's question in a real-life scenario? (given a customer service workflow)

## 5.2 Challenges and Solutions


In the realm of interpretable rationale queries, an additional challenge is integrating domain-specific rationales into LLMs in an comprehensible manner. The primary challenges are as follows:

- Prompt Optimization Costs : The process of optimizing prompts is marked by high time and computational demands. Distinct queries demand tailored background knowledge and decision-making criteria, necessitating diverse examples. While manually designed prompts can be highly effective, they are labor-intensive and timeconsuming. Furthermore, training models to generate tailored prompts for various queries incurs significant computational overhead.
- Limited interpretability : The impact of prompts on LLMs is opaque. In many cases, access to the internal parameters of LLMs is typically restricted, complicating efforts to determine the impact of various prompts on these models. This lack of transparency hinders our ability to consistently understand and verify the interpretability of LLM responses to different prompts.

## 5.3 Prompt Tuning


For interpretable rationale queries, the key issue is how to effectively integrate rationales provided by external data into LLMs and ensure that these models can accurately follow and react based on these rationales. Text2MDT [112] offers a viable demonstration, introducing two methods for automatically extracting medical decision trees from medical guidelines and textbooks. This process clarifies the logical chains within lengthy medical texts, making them more comprehensible. Similarly, MedDM [113] has developed a format for clinical guidance trees that can be executed by LLMs, proposing a methodology for reasoning on these executable CGTs and a framework for multi-turn dialogues between patients and LLMs. InstructRec [114] aims to leverage the capabilities of LLMs in recommendation systems, designing a universal format to describe a user's preferences, intentions, task forms, and context using natural language, thereby creating a high-performing, language-based recommendation system.


Integrating rationales directly as natural language instructions into LLMs does not necessarily yield optimal performance, and manually designing prompts can be time-consuming. To address this, the employment of prompt tuning techniques becomes essential to enhance the LLMs' capability to adhere to specific rationales. One effective methodology is the application of reinforcement learning, as evidenced by the TEMPERA framework [115], which designs prompts incorporating limited instructions, examples, and verbalizers within the action space of reinforcement learning. Here, the LLM's probability of generating correct responses serves as the reward, guiding the model to discover the optimal prompt configuration across datasets. Similarly, Rlprompt [116] adopts a reinforcement learning approach, training an adaptor to assist smaller language models in producing optimal prompts based on feedback concerning the relative
