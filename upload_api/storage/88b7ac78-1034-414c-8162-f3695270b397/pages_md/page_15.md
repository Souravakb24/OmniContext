To address these types of queries, a common approach is to identify and extract rules and guidelines from datasets offline, subsequently retrieving related items. For generate reasoning rationales, some work like STaR [137] and LXS [138] used LLM for rationale generation. The former employs an iterative few-shot example method to generate from small dataset to large dataset, the later introduced a two-role explaining extraction process where a learner model generated explanations and a critic model assess them for validation.


GL [139] identifies errors and generalizes them into guidelines for future tasks through an in-context-learning. LEAP [140] forms principles by generating mistakes, low-level principles, and high-level principles, incorporating these principles into prompts for final inference. RICP [141] uses mistakes from training data to generate high-level reasoning and specific insights, then employs hierarchical clustering to group modes of errors, generating task-level and question-level principles, which are combined and retrieved for question-level insights. A Buffer-of-Thought [142] uses a problem distiller to distill a meta-buffer across many reasoning tasks.


Some integrated methods, like MedPrompt [143], include GPT-4-generated chains of thought for training examples with self-validation, using these in conjunction with a KNN retrieval in-context learning approach. Agent Hospital [144] generates rationales through reflection and utilizes both record retrieval and experience retrieval on generated data.


Although these concepts go by many different names-such as guidelines, principles, experiences, and thought templates-the main idea is to extract common useful rationales to enhance reasoning queries. These rationales may come from self-generated chains of thought (MedPrompt, Buffer-of-Thought), training set mistakes (GL, RICP, Agent Hospital), or intentionally generated mistakes (LEAP). Additionally, some principles are used across all tasks (Agent Hospital, RICP), while others are dynamically retrieved for specific questions (MedPrompt, Buffer-of-Thought). Many of these works demonstrate that learning from cases to accumulate experience as rationales is beneficial for various reasoning tasks.


## 6.4 In Context Learning (ICL)


Using examples for in-context learning is a common method for uncovering hidden rationales. Pre-trained large language models exhibit substantial in-context learning capabilities, which can be enhanced by retrieving examples based on similarity, thereby leveraging the models' few-shot learning abilities [145, 146]. However, the inclusion of irrelevant information in prompts can easily distract LLMs, leading to incorrect responses [147, 148]. OpenICL, as developed by Wu et al. [149], constructed an ICL framework that explores the impact of different traditional methods of retrieving examples and inference techniques on ICL effectiveness.


Furthermore, training smaller models based on the feedback from LLMs regarding context examples to select optimal demonstrations and examples can improve the construction of context for specific tasks in a more targeted manner [150, 5, 151]. To address the issue that semantic similarity-based example retrieval may not cover the broader range of associations needed in practical tests, Su et al.[152] employed an unsupervised, graph-based selective annotation method called vote-k, constructing a more diverse and representative example database for few-shot learning. Additionally, Zhang et al.[153] proposed an Auto-CoT method that clusters examples into various representative types. By sampling problems diversely and generating reasoning chains, this method constructs examples that better support the learning process.


However, enabling LLMs to master reasoning capabilities outside their trained domains through few-shot learning remains a substantial challenge. Wang et al. addressed this by sampling a variety of reasoning paths and marginalizing over these paths to select the most consistent answer, thereby enhancing the probability of LLMs selecting correct reasoning chains [154]. Agarwal et al. introduced two scalable methods for generating usable example, namely reinforced ICL and unsupervised ICL, that aim to replace human-generated examples, thus expanding the pool of available examples [155]. DIN-SQL [156] sought to decompose tasks into simpler subtasks and used the solutions to these sub-problems as prompts for LLMs, significantly improving their performance in generating SQL from text. Similarly, DUP [157] identified three main issues LLMs face when using the chain of thought approach to solve complex mathematical word problems: semantic misunderstandings, computational errors, and missing steps, with semantic misunderstandings being a primary limiting factor. Encouraging LLMs to deeply understand the problems and extract essential information for resolution can significantly enhance their ability to solve mathematical problems by addressing these semantic misunderstandings.


In-context learning is increasingly being utilized across various fields such as mathematics, law, medicine, and finance [158, 159, 160], playing a crucial role in the development of data-augmented LLM applications. This approach not only extends the functional capabilities of LLMs but also enhances their practical utility across diverse domains.


## 6.5 Fine-tuning


Despite the robust in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, accurately identifying rationales or optimal examples for complex and lengthy logical chains remains a significant challenge. Additionally, the provision of extensive external prior knowledge can also pose challenges to the inference capabilities of LLMs. Given these factors, fine-tuning emerges as a promising approach. It not only utilizes the extensive foundational knowledge that LLMs acquire during pretraining but also enables them to rapidly grasp new domain rationales. This method provides a viable path for enhancing the adaptability and effectiveness of LLMs in tackling advanced and specialized tasks.
