- Reduction in Model Hallucination: Data augmented LLM applications generate responses based on real data, grounding their reactions in facts and significantly minimizing the possibility of hallucinations.
- Improved Controllability and Explainability: The data used can serve as a reference for the model's predictions, enhancing both controllability and explainability.

Despite the enthusiasm for these advancements, developers often struggle and have to invest a significant amount of human labor to meet its expectations ( e.g., achieving a high success rate in question answering). Numerous studies [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] highlight the challenges and frustrations involved in constructing a data augmented LLM applications based on technologies like RAG and fine-tuning, particularly in specialized domains such as the legal field, healthcare, manufacturing, and others.


These challenges span a wide range, from constructing data pipelines ( e.g., data processing and indexing) to leveraging LLMs' capabilities to achieve complex intelligent reasoning. For example, in applications of finance, there is a frequent need to understand and utilize high-dimensional time series data, whereas in healthcare, medical images or time-series medical records are often essential. Enabling LLMs to comprehend these varied forms of data represents a recurring challenge. On the other hand, in legal and mathematical applications, LLMs typically struggle to grasp long-distance dependencies between different structures. Additionally, depending on the specific application domain, there are increased demands for the interpretability and consistency of LLM responses. The inherent nature of LLMs tends to be characterized by low interpretability and high uncertainty, which poses significant challenges. Enhancing the transparency of LLMs and reducing their uncertainty are critical for increasing trust and reliability in their outputs, especially in fields where precision and accountability are paramount.


Through extensive discussions with domain experts and developers, and by carefully analyzing the challenges they face, we have gained a deep understanding that data augmented LLM applicationsis not a one-size-fits-all solution. The real-world demands, particularly in expert domains, are highly complex and can vary significantly in their relationship with given data and the reasoning difficulties they require. However, developers often do not realize these distinctions and end up with a solution full of performance pitfalls (akin to a house with leaks everywhere). In contrast, if we could fully understand the demands at different levels and their unique challenges, we could build applications accordingly and make the application steadily improve (like constructing a solid and reliable house step by step).


Yet, research efforts and existing relevant surveys [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] frequently focus on only one of these levels or a particular topic of technologies. This has motivated us to compile this comprehensive survey, which aims to clearly define these different levels of queries, identify the unique challenges associated with each(Figure 1) , and list related works and efforts addressing them. This survey is intended to help readers construct a bird's-eye view of data augmented LLM applications and also serve as a handbook on how to approach the development of such applications systematically.


## 2 Problem Definition


Data-augmented LLM applications can take many forms, ranging from the frequently seen Question-Answering bots based on domain-specific data, to semantic processing operators within complex data pipelines, or even agents handling specific steps in a multi-agent system. However, in general, a data-augmented LLM application can be formulated as follows:


$$
f \colon \mathcal { Q } \stackrel { \mathcal { \nu } } { \rightarrow } A
$$


where Q , A , and D represent the user's input (Query), the expected response (Answer), and the given data, respectively. The task of the application f is to establish the mapping from Q to A based on D .


In contrast to standalone LLM systems that rely solely on pre-existing knowledge, data augmented LLM applications are characterized by their reliance on external data ( D ) to accurately address the posed queries ( Q ). The incorporation of external data D can significantly bolster the capabilities of LLMs, granting them the ability to tap into current, domainspecific knowledge and to understand expert rationales. Queries can be stratified into various levels of complexity based on the extent and manner in which they utilize external data, reflecting the depth and nature of engagement required by the queries.


## 2.1 Stratification of Queries


In the landscape of data-augmented LLM applications, queries can be stratified based on their complexity and the depth of data interaction required. This stratification helps in understanding the varying levels of cognitive processing that an LLM must perform to generate accurate and relevant responses. From straightforward fact retrieval to the nuanced interpretation of implicit knowledge, each level represents a step up in the sophistication of the tasks that LLMs are expected to handle. Below, we delineate these levels, providing insights into the unique challenges and capabilities necessitated at each stage.
