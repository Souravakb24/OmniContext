*Table 1: Stratification of Common Datasets Providing Facts*


## 3.1.1 Data Dependency


The dataset D can be segmented into documents or segments, denoted as D 1 , D 2 , . . . , D n , in various ways:


$$
\mathcal { D } = \{ D _ { 1 } , D _ { 2 } , \dots , D _ { n } \}
$$


Each segment D i is considered relatively short and contains content that is more focused and specific 2 .


For a given query q ∈ Q , not every segment within D is requisite for formulating a response. Let δ : Q×D→{ 0 , 1 } denote the necessity of data segment d ∈ D for a specific query q , where δ ( q, d ) = 1 means that data segment d is required to answer the query q , and δ ( q, d ) = 0 otherwise. Then the data dependency of query q , characterized by the subset of segments indispensable for addressing query q , is defined as:


$$
D e p ( q ) = \{ d \ | \ d \in \mathcal { D } \ \text {and} \ \delta ( q , d ) = 1 \}
$$


It's easy to understand that Dep ( q ) ∈ P ( D ) , where P ( D ) is the power set 3 of D .


## 3.1.2 Definition


Explicit fact queries, denoted as Q 1 , are characterized by the direct retrievability of answers from specific data segments within the dataset D . These queries can be formally defined in the context of a data-augmented LLM system as follows:


For any query q and its corresponding answer a , an explicit fact query is one where there exists:

- A retrieval component r D : Q → P ( D ) that identifies the relevant data segments from D necessary to answer q . This component ensures that r D ( q ) closely matches Dep ( q ) , the minimal subset of D required to respond to q .
- A response generator θ , typically a prompted LLM inference, that constructs the answer a based solely on the information retrieved by r D . The response θ ( r D ( q )) should be equal to or approximate a , demonstrating the query's reliance on explicit, directly accessible facts.

2 In some most recent advancements, the segment size may be as large as a whole document or even larger


3 The power set (or powerset) of a set S is the set of all subsets of S , including the empty set and S itself.
