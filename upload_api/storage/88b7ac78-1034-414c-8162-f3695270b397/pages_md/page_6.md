This definition underscores the reliance of explicit fact querieson direct data retrieval without the need for complex reasoning or inference beyond the scope of the identified data segments.


Here are some examples of queries at this level:

- What method was used in Paper X to solve problem Y? (given a collection of academic papers)
- What's the AI strategy of company X? (given a series of the latest news and articles about company X)

## 3.2 Challenges and Solutions


Queries at this level primarily necessitate the correct retrieval of data for LLMs to provide accurate responses. RAG [6], due to its effectiveness, flexibility, and relatively low costs, is the most commonly adopted technical solution for handling this level of queries. However, even with RAG, there are significant challenges in constructing a robust and high-quality system. These challenges include:

- Data Processing Difficulties : External data is often highly unstructured and contains multi-modal components such as tables, images, videos, and more. Additionally, the process of segmenting or "chunking" this data presents challenges in maintaining the original context and meaning.
- Data Retrieval Difficulties : The retrieval of relevant data segments from a large, unstructured dataset can be computationally intensive and prone to errors. The challenge lies in developing efficient and accurate retrieval mechanisms.
- Evaluation Difficulties : Evaluating the performance of a RAG system, particularly at a component level, is a complex task. It requires the development of robust metrics that can accurately assess the quality of data retrieval and response generation.

Given the popularity of RAG, a wealth of literature and tools have been developed to address these challenges. In the remainder of this section, we will highlight some of the most practical and impactful enhancements to RAG. Additionally, we will discuss alternative technical solutions that may be employed beyond RAG.


## 3.3 Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG)


Retrieval-Augmented Generation refers to a methodology where a language model augments its natural language generation capabilities by dynamically retrieving external information during the generation process. This technique blends the generative capabilities of LLMs with the information retrieval from extensive databases or documents. The process is typically implemented as data index construction, retrieval system construction and answer generation.


## 3.3.1 Data Processing Enhancement


Document parsing at this level often involves extracting information from text, tables, and figures in a coherent manner, ensuring that the relevant snippets are accurately identified and retrieved.


Multi-modal Documents Parsing Addressing multi-modal content in source documents, such as charts, tables, or even videos (e.g. meeting recordings), is one of the most frequently asked questions. Broadly, two approaches are employed to tackle this issue. The first approach involves converting multi-modal content into textual form. For instance, Table-to-Text methods [34] translate tables into text, while other techniques convert visual content into textual or attribute-based descriptions [35, 36], which are subsequently processed by large language models. The second approach leverages multi-modal embedding techniques [37, 38, 39], utilizing the retrieved embeddings from multi-modal data as soft prompts for input.


Chunking Optimization For long texts, segmenting documents into text chunks is a common and necessary operation. Larger text chunks can preserve more of the semantic coherence of the context, but they also tend to contain more noise within each chunk[40]. Commonly-used chunking strategies [41, 42] include fixed size chunking, recursive chunking, sliding window chunking, paragraph-based chunking ,semantic chunking, etc. Certain methods are designed to ascertain the level of detail a query demands and, based on this identification, select text chunks of appropriate granularity for retrieval[43, 44]. Alternatively, some methods opt to process and refine the text into smaller segments that maintain a high degree of information completeness[45]. Additionally, there are approaches that employ vision models to segment text in accordance with the original document structure[46].
