of the original query into multiple retrieval operations and the aggregation of results into a comprehensive answer. This level often involves common-sense reasoning without requiring domain-specific expertise. This type of queries may include statistical queries, descriptive analysis queries, and basic aggregation queries. For example, operations such as counting, comparison, trend analysis, and selective summarization are common in "how many" and "what's the most" type queries, while multi-hop reasoning is frequently used. Therefore, we can define the level-2 queries, Q 2 as follows:


For any query q and its corresponding answer a , a Q 2 fact query is one where:

- There exists a set of explicit fact queries { q 1 , q 2 , . . . , q m } ⊂ Q 1 , each of which can be directly retrieved from specific data segments within the dataset D , such that:

$$
r _ { D } ( q ) = \bigcup _ { i = 1 } ^ { m } r _ { D } ( q _ { i } )
$$


where r D ( q i ) identifies the relevant data segments from D necessary to answer q i , and the union of these segments provides the information necessary to answer q .

- A response generator θ , typically a prompted LLM inference, constructs the answer a to q by aggregating the responses { θ ( r D ( q 1 )) , θ ( r D ( q 2 )) , . . . , θ ( r D ( q m )) } and applying common-sense reasoning to derive an answer that is not explicitly stated in the data. The response θ ( r D ( q )) should approximate the correct answer a , demonstrating that the query q can be effectively answered through the aggregation of responses to the Q 1 queries.

This definition underscores the reliance of Q 2 queries on the ability to decompose complex queries into a set of simpler, explicit fact queries Q 1 , whose answers can then be combined to generate the correct response to the original query Q 2 .


Here are some examples of queries at this level:

- How many experiments have sample sizes greater than 1000? (given a collection of experimental records)
- What are the top 3 most frequently mentioned symptoms? (given a collection of medical records)
- What's the difference between the AI strategies of company X and company Y? (given a series of the latest news and articles about companies X and Y)

## 4.2 Challenges and Solutions


At this level, queries still revolve around factual questions, but the answers are not explicitly presented in any single text passage. Instead, they require combining multiple facts through common-sense reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. The challenges of a level-2 query primarily include:

- Adaptive retrieval volumes : Different questions may require varying numbers of retrieved contexts, and the specific number of retrieved contexts can depend on both the question and the dataset. A fixed number of retrievals may result in either information noise or insufficient information.
- Coordination between reasoning and retrieval : Reasoning can guide the focus of what needs to be retrieved, while the insights gained from retrieved information can iteratively refine reasoning strategies. Addressing these complexities calls for an intelligent integration and selective harnessing of external data, capitalizing on the inherent reasoning prowess of LLMs.

Methods to address challenges at this level include iterative RAG, RAG on graph/tree, and RAG with SQL, among others.


## 4.3 Iterative RAG


Implicit fact queries is similar to multi-hop RAG tasks. This category of methods dynamically controls multi-step RAG processes, iteratively gathering or correcting information until the correct answer is achieved.

- Planning-based : Generating a stepwise retrieval plan during the prior-retrieval stage or dynamically within the retrieval process can refine the focus of each retrieval, efficiently guiding the iterative RAG system. For example, ReAct [93] progressively updates the target of each step, reducing the knowledge gap required to answer the question. IRCoT [94] and RAT[95] uses a Chain of Thought to guide the RAG pipeline, making decisions about the current retrieval target based on previously recalled information. GenGround [96]
